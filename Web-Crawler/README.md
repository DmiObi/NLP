#Web-Cralwer

## About the project
The program receives a URL link and finds all links that it can find on the website. Then the program scrabs all the text from those websites using Beautiful Soup 
and cleans it up. All the text is then combined into one big text. The program then finds the most common words used on those websites as well as creates
a dictionary that keeps track of all lines where a specific word was present.
