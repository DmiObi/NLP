# N-grams

## About the project
In this project, 3 different text files that contain texts that are written in different languages are used to create 3 language models. Then those language models are used on a different text to find out which model would better predict the contents of the text. For every line, the best language model was chosen and outputted into a file. LaPlase smoothing was used for calculating probabilities. 

## How to run this program
1. Run the command "Pyhon program1.py ."
